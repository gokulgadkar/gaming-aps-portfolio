## Introduction
 World of gaming is full of maths and algorithms. From path finding to move unit towards user specified destination to complex AI npcs that react to player's play style. Algorithms help create most elements in gaming world, so designing better algorithms / replacing existing algorithms with more suitable becomes a must for game developers.

Problems faced:
1. Device Contraints
2. Time of reaction (Of NPC/ of elements in games)
3. Realistic reaction of elements (More realistic == More complexities)

## Why Portfolio
 

## Objectives
  1. Exploring agorithms employed
  2. Designing/ modifying bits of algorithm
  3. Implementation of different algorithm and discussion of experimentation

## Design


## Challenges
List the main challenges faced during the development and deployment of the OTT platform, along with proposed or implemented solutions.

## To-Do List
Enumerate upcoming tasks, feature enhancements, and milestones for the platformâ€™s roadmap.
